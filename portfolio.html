				<h1><br />Portfolio</h1>
				<p> Here is a collection of projects I have worked on. Projects not listed here can be found on GitHub where my username is HerrAndersson. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/HerrAndersson">HerrAndersson on Github</a></p>

					<h2>VileCorp</h2>

					<iframe class="centered_object" width="720" height="405" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jOgy49PNFBk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p>
						This game was created as the final project of the program at BTH, in a group of 14 members (5 Teachnical Artists and 9 Game programmers). It is a strategy game where you play as a security company with the objective to prevent thieves from stealing valuable objectives from your clients. You have several traps at your disposal, and you can use two types of guards that you can give commands to. There is also a level editor where you can build you own maps and design the missions. <br />
						My part of this project was to implement the graphics "engine" and things regarding the optimization of the pipeline. Part of the project was to have the game run on an Intel NUC with an i5 processor and Intel Integrated 6000 graphics, using at most 256MB RAM and in at least 30 fps.
						<br /><br />
						Included in the project was also to work with Scrum, with sprints each week, morning meetings, sprint evaluation etc.

					<h2>nightlight</h2>
					<iframe class="centered_object" width="720" height="405" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hSGGY9XV3Hk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p>
						This game was created in a group of 6 members (4 Technical Artists and 2 Game programmers). It is a puzzle game where you play as a little boy who is trapped in his grandfathers secret lab after an experiment went wrong. Shadow creatures escaped and will try to kill you, but you can use your flashlight to push them away. Using switches, boxes and the creatures themselves you must try to find your grandfather and escape the lab.
						<br /><br /> As we were only two programmers we both worked on most parts together, but the graphics "engine" and the AI was done by me alone.

					<h2>Seam Carving</h2>
					<iframe class="centered_object" width="580" height="435" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y0PNoRbOMHw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p>
						This is an implementation of Seam Carving (S. Avidan and A. Shamir, 2007), which is a way of resizing images by removing pixels of low importance. It was implemented in C++ and Direct3D 10.

					<h2>Space Shooter</h2>
					<iframe class="centered_object" width="580" height="435" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kzqMsWUarBs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p>
						A Space shooter where you play as a ship and should stay alive for as long as possible while waves of enemy ships attack you. It was implemented in XNA and C#.

					<h2>Luabyrint</h2>
					<iframe class="centered_object" width="580" height="435" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RZIrMocRPxc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p>
						A small labyrinth game implemented using lua to handle all logic. There is a mode for playing the game and a mode for building new levels, which are saved and updated in real time, making it possible to switch back to the play mode and play the new level any time.
