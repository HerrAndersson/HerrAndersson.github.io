						My bachelor's thesis was about the differences between techniques used to switch between LoD's. 
						The main focus was to examine how silhouette based Phong Tessellation compared to Curved PN Triangles, Static LoD, and Unpopping LoD.
					</p>
					<p>
						Phong Tessellation and Curved PN Triangles are both implemented using hardware tessellation. Unpopping LoD is implemented using alpha blending.
					</p>

					<h2>VileCorp</h2>

					<p>
						This game was created as the final project of the program at BTH, in a group of 14 members (5 Technical Artists and 9 Game programmers). 
						It is a strategy game where you play as a security company with the objective to prevent thieves from stealing valuable objects from your clients. 
						You have several traps at your disposal, and you can use two types of guards which can be given commands. 
						There is also a level editor where you can build you own maps and design missions.
					</p>
					<p>
						My part of this project was to implement the graphics "engine" (Direct3D 11), where I have implemented everything except for the antialiasing and animation shaders. 
						Part of the project was to have the game run on an Intel NUC with an i5 processor and Intel Integrated 6000 graphics, using at most 256MB RAM in at least 30 fps. 
						To meet these requirements, I also did a lot of optimization, such as developing an algorithm which scans the map and combines tiles of the same type to save draw calls.
					</p>
					<p>
						Included in the project was also to work with Scrum, with sprints each week, morning meetings, sprint evaluation etc.

					<h2>nightlight</h2>
					<iframe class="centered_object" width="720" height="405" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hSGGY9XV3Hk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p>
						This game was created in a group of 6 members (4 Technical Artists and 2 Game programmers). 
						It is a puzzle game where you play as a little boy who is trapped in his grandfathers secret lab after an experiment went wrong. 
						Shadow creatures escaped and will try to kill you, but you can use your flashlight to push them away. 
						Using switches, boxes and the creatures themselves you must try to find your grandfather and escape the lab.
					</p>
					<p>
						Since we were only two programmers, both of us worked on most parts together, but the graphics "engine" (Direct3D 11) and the AI was done by me alone. 
						The AI is a simple 3-state statemachine, which is using my implementation of A* for pathfinding.

					<h2>Seam Carving</h2>
					<iframe class="centered_object" width="580" height="435" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y0PNoRbOMHw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p>
						This is an implementation of Seam Carving (S. Avidan and A. Shamir, 2007), which is a way of resizing images by removing pixels of low importance. 
						It was implemented in C++ and Direct3D 10.

					<h2>Space Shooter</h2>
					<iframe class="centered_object" width="580" height="435" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kzqMsWUarBs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p>
						A Space shooter where you play as a ship. The objective is to stay alive as long as possible while waves of enemy ships attack you. It was implemented in C# using XNA.

					<h2>Luabyrint</h2>
					<iframe class="centered_object" width="580" height="435" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RZIrMocRPxc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p>
						A small labyrinth game implemented using lua to handle all logic. There are two modes: playing the game and building new levels. 
						The levels are saved and updated in real time, making it possible to switch back to the play mode and play the new level any time.
